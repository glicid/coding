# 🧠 Coding Practice: C++ & Python

This repository contains C++ and Python practice programs side by side to help you learn programming fundamentals in both languages.  
Inspired by [LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com) and [LearnPython.org](https://www.learnpython.org).

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
coding/
├── cpp/              # C++ examples
│   ├── strings.cpp
│   └── ...
├── python/           # Python examples
│   ├── strings.py
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

Each file in `cpp/` has a corresponding example in `python/` showing the same concept in both languages.
